Descriptive Statistics is the method of summarizing and organizing the data to understand patterns and trends. It includes:

1. Measures of Central Tendency:

These give us an idea of the central value of the dataset.

Mean: Average of all data points.

Formula: Mean = (∑X) / N


Median: Middle value when data is sorted.

Mode: Most frequent value.


2. Measures of Dispersion (Variability):

These show how much the data varies or is spread out.

Range: Difference between max and min values.

Standard Deviation (SD): Shows how much values deviate from the mean.

Variance: Square of the standard deviation.


Grouped Data Concepts:

For grouped/continuous data, special formulas are used for mean, median, and mode using frequency, class width, etc.

KEY POINTS 

1. Descriptive Statistics ka use data summarize karne ke liye hota hai.

2. Mean – sab values ka average hota hai.

3. Median – beech ka value hota hai (sorted data mein).

4. Mode – sabse zyada baar aane wala number.

5. Standard Deviation – values kitna mean se door hai, yeh batata hai.

6. Variability – data kitna spread hai, uska idea deta hai.

7. Categorical group karke hum summary nikal sakte hai (e.g., Age group wise Income).

8. Python mein describe(), mean(), std() etc. functions se yeh stats nikalte hai.

ADVANTAGES:

Data ko samajhne mein easy banata hai.

Decision making mein help karta hai.

Summary analysis time-saving hota hai.

Variability samajhne mein madad karta hai.



---

DISADVANTAGES:

Outliers (extreme values) ka effect padta hai, specially on mean.

Data distribution ka detail idea nahi milta.

Misleading ho sakta hai if not interpreted properly.

APPLICATIONS:

Business: Sales/marketing analysis.

Healthcare: Patient data analysis.

Education: Student performance reports.

Data Science: Initial data exploration and analysis.
