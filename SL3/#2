Unit II – Introduction to Data Science



1. Basics and Need of Data Science
Data Science is the study of data using mathematics, statistics, and computer tools.

It helps in identifying patterns, trends, and meaningful insights from large datasets.

It is important because huge amounts of data are generated from social media, applications, sensors, etc.

Data Science supports better decision-making and real-world problem-solving.




2. Applications of Data Science
Healthcare: Disease prediction, medical data analysis.

Finance: Fraud detection, credit risk analysis.

E-commerce: Product recommendations, customer behavior analysis.

Transport: Route optimization, traffic prediction.

Social Media: Trend analysis, personalized content suggestions.




3. Relationship between Data Science and Information Science
Data Science focuses on analyzing data and making predictions.

Information Science deals with organizing, storing, and retrieving information.

Data Science depends on Information Science to access and manage useful data.

Both fields complement each other — one handles data storage, the other handles analysis.




4. Business Intelligence (BI) vs Data Science
Aspect	Business Intelligence (BI)	Data Science
Focus	Analyzing past data	Predicting future trends
Tools	Dashboards, reports	Machine learning, AI
Approach	Descriptive analysis	Predictive & prescriptive
Example	Sales reports	Predicting customer churn




5. Data Types
Structured Data: Organized in rows and columns (e.g., Excel spreadsheets).

Unstructured Data: No fixed format (e.g., videos, images, free text).

Semi-structured Data: Partially organized (e.g., XML, JSON, HTML).




6. Data Collection
The process of gathering raw data from various sources.

Common Sources:

Surveys and online forms

Websites (through web scraping)

IoT devices and sensors

APIs and databases

Good quality data collection ensures accurate analysis and results.




7. Need of Data Wrangling
Raw data is often incomplete, inconsistent, or contains errors.

Data wrangling is required to clean, structure, and prepare data for analysis.

It is an essential step before applying data science techniques or machine learning models.

It improves efficiency and accuracy in data-driven projects.




8. Methods of Data Wrangling (C.I.R.T.D.)
C – Cleaning: Removing incorrect, missing, or duplicate data.

I – Integration: Combining data from different sources into one dataset.

R – Reduction: Removing unnecessary or redundant data to simplify analysis.

T – Transformation: Changing the format, units, or scale of data (e.g., INR to USD).

D – Discretization: Converting continuous data into categories (e.g., age into child/teen/adult).
