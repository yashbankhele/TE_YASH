🔬 Practical Title:
Implementation of Linear Threshold Gate using NumPy

📖 Theory in Simple English:
A Linear Threshold Gate (LTG) is a basic model used in Machine Learning and Neural Networks to make decisions. It takes input values, multiplies them with weights, adds them, and then compares the result with a threshold.

If the result is greater than or equal to the threshold, it gives output 1.

Otherwise, it gives output 0.

It is also called a Binary Step Function or Threshold Function.

This type of gate is used in Perceptrons, which are the basic building blocks of Neural Networks. LTG helps the machine decide whether to activate a neuron or not.

📌 Detailed Bullet Points:
✅ A Linear Threshold Gate (LTG) is a decision-making function used in AI and ML.

✅ It takes multiple inputs and applies weights to them.

✅ It calculates the dot product (i.e., sum of input × weight).

✅ It compares the result to a threshold (T).

✅ If result ≥ T, then output = 1 (active).

✅ Else, output = 0 (inactive).

✅ Used for simple binary classification (Yes/No, True/False).

✅ Implemented using NumPy in Python for matrix operations.

✅ Very useful in Perceptron Algorithm and Neural Networks.

✅ It is one of the simplest models to understand how neurons work.

🧠 Formula:
python
Copy
Edit
dot_product = inputs @ weights
output = 1 if dot_product >= threshold else 0
🔁 Use Case Example:
Imagine you want to decide:

If a student passes based on marks in two subjects.

Assign weight to each subject and a threshold (passing marks).

LTG will give 1 (Pass) or 0 (Fail) depending on total marks.

🔧 Python Concepts Used:
NumPy for array and matrix operations

@ operator for dot product (matrix multiplication)

if-else for checking threshold condition

for loop to check all input combinations
